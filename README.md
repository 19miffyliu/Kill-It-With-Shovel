Have you ever meet a turret face-to-face at the entrance?

If you have--and like me, are super annoyed by it, this mod is for you! 

# Description
You can now:
- Disable the turret for 5 seconds by hitting it with a shovel.
- Enable the turret again by hitting it twice.  **BEWARE: turret does NOT like being disturbed in sleep.**
