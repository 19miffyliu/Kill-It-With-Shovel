# Kill-It-With-Shovel

# Introduction

Have you ever meet a turret face-to-face at the entrance?

![](https://github.com/19miffyliu/Kill-It-With-Shovel/blob/main/asset/gif/CommonScenario.gif)

If you have--and like me, you're super annoyed by it, this mod is for you! 

# Description
You can now:
- Disable the turret for 5 seconds by hitting it with a shovel.
- Enable the turret again by hitting it twice.  **BEWARE: turret does NOT like being disturbed in sleep.**

# How to Install
Go to [ThunderStore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/MiffyL/Kill_It_With_Shovel/), click manual install., then launch the game from Thunderstore.


# Compatibility

- Any mod that does not tweak turret behavior


## This mod is incompatible with:
- [**Fair AI**](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/TheFluff/FairAI/): the disabled duration will be half a second no matter the config (See [issue 1](https://github.com/19miffyliu/Kill-It-With-Shovel/issues/1) for details)

## Berseker Mode when being waked

**Enabled:** The turret will fire and swing like vanilia when you hit it while it is disabled.

**Disabled:** The turret will stay disabled, but the duration will not stack the more times you hit.
